# **Offroad Autonomy Semantic Segmentation Challenge**

## **Project Overview**

This project focuses on training a robust semantic segmentation model designed for Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) in desert environments. Using synthetic data generated by Duality AI’s Falcon platform, we have developed a model to identify critical off-road classes such as trees, bushes, rocks, and traversable landscape to assist in obstacle avoidance and path planning.

## **Environment Setup & Dependencies**

To reproduce our results, ensure you have **Miniconda** or **Anaconda** installed.

1. **Navigate to the setup folder:**  
   cd \[Your-Directory-Path\]/ENV\_SETUP  
2. **Install dependencies:**  
   * **Windows:** Run `setup_env.bat` in the Anaconda Prompt.  
   * **Mac/Linux:** Use a shell script with equivalent `conda create` commands for the `EDU` environment.  
3. **Activate the environment:**  
   conda activate EDU

## **How to Run the Model**

### **1\. Training**

To re-train the model using our optimized hyperparameters:

python train.py

* **Outputs:** Model checkpoints and training logs will be saved to the `train_stats/` directory.  
* **Data Usage:** This model was trained exclusively on the provided synthetic desert dataset.

### **2\. Testing & Evaluation**

To evaluate the model on the unseen test images and generate performance metrics:
  
python test.py

## **Expected Outputs & Interpretation**

When running the `test.py` script, the following results will be generated:

* **IoU Score:** This measures the accuracy of the pixel classification (Intersection over Union). A higher score indicates better overlap with the ground truth.  
   \+1  
* **Predictions:** Segmented images saved in the results folder, color-coded by class.  
* **Loss Metrics:** Quantitative data indicating how well the model converged during training.

## **Reproducing Final Results**

To achieve our final submitted score (IoU: **\[Insert Your Final Score Here\]**), we utilized the following configuration:

* **Epochs:20 **  

## **Team & Submission Details**

* **Team Name:** Code Velocity  
* **Final Packaged Folder Includes:** `train_segmentation.py`, `test_segmentation.py`, model weights, configuration files, and the Performance Evaluation Report.
